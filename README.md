# Minecraft Finder Base

This base is made from the finder that was previously in [MCPTool](https://mcptool.net)

To execute this you must take into account the following things:

- The databases must be .json and their content must be an array of dictionaries that must contain the value "username". (You have a generic database to use as an example in the databases folder).

- To use the finder you must install the dependencies from requirements.txt and run main.py

- You have a client.py to test the finder after running it locally. Just use the python client.py username

The README file and finder were created in about 30 minutes. If you find a bug, let me know and I'll fix it. And this was created because I wanted to post something related to finders since I removed it from MCPTool, this is just a base and you can use it to create your own API, just remember to read the MIT license requirements! Good luck!
